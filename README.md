# Vulnerability-Detection-and-Cyber-Risk-Assessment-for-Android-Devices
In this project, we propose a methodology for automatically detecting the OS configuration on Android smartphones, evaluating the cyber risk related to those products, and suggesting more suitable alternative software to be updated.

## Core Design
The design for the software detection system and cyber risk assessment consisted of three phases, namely:

## Instructions on how to Run the mobile App codes

1. Install **Aâ€¢	Android Studio (2022.3.1) IDE**(the official Integrated Development Environment for building Andriod Apps)
2. Install Android SDK-2022(Software Development Kit): These are toolkits utilized by the Android development platform; they are a compilation of software development tools necessary for creating Android applications.
3. install **Java frameworks** (we utilized the Java programming language runtime version 11.0.13, OpenJDK 64-bit
4. Install JUnit: This is a unit testing framework that can be used to test Android apps and related libraries.
5. Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager: This is a tool that allows you to create and manage virtual devices for testing your Android app on different devices and configurations.

**Note:** For this project our Host System is: (MacOS Ventura 13, Apple M1 Chip with 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine; 8GB unified memory; 256GB SSD storage! (**Note: Any OS that supports Android Studio 2022 is fine**)
