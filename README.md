# Vulnerability-Detection-and-Cyber-Risk-Assessment-for-Android-Devices
In this project, we propose a methodology for automatically detecting the OS configuration on Android smartphones, evaluating the cyber risk related to those products, and suggesting more suitable alternative software to be updated.

## Core Design
The design for the software detection system and cyber risk assessment consisted of three phases, namely:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64112508/234666516-968e2de3-6a38-4b14-9081-4e0b6d2935ef.png)

2. 	Calculating total risk assessment of software
3. 	Making alternative recommendations and analysis based on constraints.
